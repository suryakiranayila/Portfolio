#**About Me**
I’m **Surya Kiran Ayila** — a **data scientist, UI/UX designer, photographer, and creative problem-solver** driven by curiosity and innovation. My work lives at the intersection of **technology, design, and storytelling**, where I combine analytical precision with a strong aesthetic sense to create solutions that are both functional and visually engaging.

With a foundation in **AI, machine learning, and data science**, I enjoy transforming raw data into meaningful insights, interactive experiences, and intuitive interfaces. My creative side is fueled by photography, visual design, and game development, while my technical side thrives on building efficient systems, experimenting with AI agents, and deploying practical applications across platforms.

I believe in **learning by building** — from designing tailored job-preparation tools like *Know2Grow*, to exploring futuristic concepts in UI/UX, to creating portfolio projects that push both technical and artistic boundaries. My interests extend beyond the screen, into **space exploration, travel, and immersive storytelling**, constantly inspiring me to think bigger and design for the future.

I aim to craft work that doesn’t just **solve problems** but also **sparks curiosity**, making technology feel approachable, human, and exciting.
